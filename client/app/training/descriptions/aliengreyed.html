    In this part of the survey, you will be asked to rate the similarities
    between individual aliens by comparing the
    aliens' facial features, and accessories such as bracelets, earrings,
    shirt patterns, etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Note: All items are unique, i.e. if two aliens are wearing 2 different bracelets, the bracelets should not be considered a similar feature.</strong>

    This is a plain alien with no extra features.
        As you can see, a plain alien is already wearing a helmet,
        a shirt, boots, socks, shorts, and a belt.
        These properties should not be considered when rating the similarity of the aliens.
